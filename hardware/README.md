Simply create a /hardware/myrobot.scad and start designing your robot in it.

Create then a /hardwara/parts folder in which the files to generate each individual parts should be included.

Update the 'hardware/generate_stl' and generate some your stls.

Once your happy, create a release adding the stl as supplementary files. Try to never upload stl directly in the git history.
