# poppy-creature-mini-template

This is the basics required to create a poppy mini creature. Best practice is to duplicate this repository: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/

- /hardware already includes the submodules needed to create frames between XL320 motors using OpenScad.
- /software should contain the config file specific to your robot
- /doc should contain the doc

A good practice is to add a picture/video of your robot here and explain how to get started. 

Once you are happy with the design, it is also a good practice to create a release with the ready to use stl files.
